Akka HTTP is
- a suite of libraries
- focues on HTTP integration of an application
- designed for both servers and clients
- based on Akka actors and Akka Streams

Akka HTTPS is NOT:
- a framework

Akka HTTP strengths:
- stream-based, with backpressure for free
- multiple API levels for control vs ease of use

Core Concepts:
- HttpRequest, HttpResponse
- HttpEntity
- marshalling

===
receive HTTP request, send HTTP response
- synchronously via a function HttpRequest => HttpResponse
- async via a function HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse]
- async via streams, with a Flow[HttpRequest, HttpResponse, _]

all of the above turn into flows sooner or later

Under the hood:
- the server receives HttpRequests (transparently)
- the requests go through the flow we write
- the resulting responses are served back (transparently)
